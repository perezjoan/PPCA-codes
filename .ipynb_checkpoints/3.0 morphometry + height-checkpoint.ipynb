    "This script performs several calculations and transformations on a layer of OSM buildings. It begins by ensuring the columns 'height' and 'building\n",
    "are numeric, converting any non-numeric entries to NaN. The script then fills missing 'height' values by multiplying floors by 3, assuming an \n",
    "average floor height of 3 meters. Conversely, it fills missing building values by dividing 'height' by 3 and rounding the result. It calculates and\n",
    "prints the number and percentage of rows with NaN in both 'height' and 'building. Several new columns are computed: 'FL' for the number of floors,\n",
    "'A' for the surface area, 'P' for the perimeter, 'E' for elongation, 'C' for convexity, 'FA' for floor area, 'ECA' for a product involving \n",
    "elongation, convexity, and area, 'EA' for another elongation-area product, and 'SW' for shared walls ratio. Finally, the script renames \n",
    "'building:floors' to 'FL'.\n",
